  <h2>What is Nimbus</h2>
  <body>The cloud storage industry is still growing. It’s a great time to jump into this ever-expanding technology and innovate on the ideas that could be expressed in the cloud storage space. This is where Nimbus comes in. Nimbus wants to rethink how cloud storage works and do the job most efficiently.</body>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <body>Find the right combination of features for a cloud service to meet the needs of the clients audience. To find what is different about Nimbus that user will gravitate towards instead of one of the competitors.</body>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h2>The solution</h2>
    <body>We created a solution where the user can upload files, share, and organize files. For future state, we would like to allow editing of both word documents, and image files.</body>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <h1>Discovery Phase</h1>

    <h2>User Interviews</h2>
    <body>I wanted to make sure I understood where the user was coming from for cloud storage needs. So I asked many questions, but these are a few:
      <li>What are the advantages of using cloud storage?</li>
      <li>What bothers you about the current service you use?</li>
      <li>What do you love about the current service you use?</li>
      <li>What are important features for a cloud service platform?</li>
      <li>What do you primarily use the cloud storage for?</li>

      <li>We interviewed 24 different users from different parts of the country.</li>
     </body>
